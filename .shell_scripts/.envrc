# Paths
# -----

# The USR_PATHS variable will just store all relevant /usr paths for easier usage
# Each path is seperate via a : and we always use absolute paths.
# A bit about the /usr directory
# The /usr directory is a convention from linux that creates a common place to put
# files and executables that the entire system needs access too. It tries to be user
# independent, so whichever user is logged in should have permissions to the /usr directory.
# We call that /usr/local. Within /usr/local, there is a bin directory for actually
# storing the binaries (programs) that our system would want.
# Also, Homebrew adopts this convetion so things installed via Homebrew
# get symlinked into /usr/local
export USR_PATHS="/usr/local:/usr/local/sbin"
export OPT_PATH="/opt"
export PATH="$OPT_PATH:$USR_PATHS:$POSTGRES_PATH:$PATH:$PYTHON_PATH:$PIP_PATH:$GOPATH:$ANDROID_PATH"

# ARM Macs use /opt
# brew now uses this convention and requires initialization via the following line:
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
